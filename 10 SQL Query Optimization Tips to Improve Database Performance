Top 10 SQL Query Optimization Tips to Improve Database Performance

Indexing: Ensure proper indexing for quick access to the database.
Select query: Specify the columns in SELECT query instead of SELECT* to avoid extra fetching load on the database.
Running queries: Loops in query structure slows the sequence. Thus, avoid them.
Matching records: Use EXITS() for matching if the record exists.
Subqueries: Avoid correlated sub queries as it searches row by row, impacting the speed of SQL query processing.
Wildcards: Use wildcards (e.g. %xx%) wisely as they search the entire database for matching results.
Operators: Avoid using function at RHS of the operator.
Fetching data: Always fetch limited data.
Loading: Use a temporary table to handle bulk data.
Selecting Rows: Use the clause WHERE instead of HAVING for primary filters.
